    <p>The threat of hackers and crackers is for real, and is alike for everything for everyone. If 
    the security breach at the Babha Atomic Research Center last year by the hacker group 
    milworm didnâ€™t convince you of their capabilities, then consider this: James Davis aka 
    jdavis_a, a resident of <font color="blue">www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bit/2483</font> homestead community 
    on the Internet, might just be reading your e-mail in your mailbox right now, or using 
    your account for some benign Internet surfing, or exchanging it with someone else on the 
    Net for more such accounts!</p>

    <p>Surprised? Or scared?</p>

    <p>Formula:<br>
    (a-b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> - 2ab + b<sup>2</sup><br>
    C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub></p>

    <p>Whatever it is, jdevis_4 claims in his home page <font color="red">Free VSNL passwords</font> that he has got 
    exactly 108 working passwords (and growing daily), 36 satyam, 31 MNTL, 11 WimiNet 
    and 23 online passwords.</p>
